> Our client has written an object-detection library in Python and is interested in creating a desktop application to display his library at work. The primary use case for the application is within the client's lab in the UNC computer science department. The client is also interested in providing access to the application to anyone who downloads his code from GitHub. A website to demo the code would be nice, but isn't a primary goal of the project.
