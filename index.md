### Our client has written an object-detection library in Python and is interested in creating a desktop application to display his library at work. The primary use case for the application is within the client's lab in the UNC computer science department. The client would like to be able to run the application on his desktop to present his object-detection code to visitors to the lab. The client also believes that it could be interesting to allow anyone who downloaded the code from GitHub to be able to run the desktop application as well. A website to run the code on is desirable, but isn't a primary goal of the project.
