* Phil will provide us with a TAR file containing pre-defined target images which he would like to include in the application. He would like us to make it so that this collection could be changed by him in the future without too much work.
	* The target images come in pairs. One shows the 'front' of the object and the other shows the 'back'.
* The numpy arrays should be in an RGB format when passed to the object detection code. No A.
